## *Hello ⚡*<br/>

I'm Arnab Mallick, a Distributed Systems Researcher and IoT Architect from India.

Here, I share advanced system simulations, multi-agent protocol experiments, and real-world IoT deployments—from national-scale water infrastructure to open-source toolkits—focused on resilient engineering, deep empirical validation, and building future-ready platforms.

Every robust distributed system blends rigorous research, hands-on design, and collaborative improvement, evolving through dynamic user communities and practical field challenges.
